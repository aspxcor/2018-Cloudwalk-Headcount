# 2018-Cloudwalk-Headcount
The files in this project are the source code and various training set files of the Cloud Head Counting Competition in 2018.
## Background
* With the continuous expansion and prosperity of urban commercial districts, more and more people are shopping, catering, finding leisure and entertainment in the business district. Behind the bustling business district is a huge hidden danger. In the event of an emergency, all types of risks will be amplified in crowd district. In recent years, many crowded and trampling accidents occurred worldwide have fired the alarm for the management of urban business districts.
* Cloudwalk Technology has been incubating from the Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2015. Cloudwalk has also helped draft and develop national standard on face recognition. Its technology application covers many industries, such as banking, security, and aviation.
* In 2018, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) entrusted CloudWalk, alongside with Beijing Zhongdun under the First Research Institute of the Ministry of Public Security, for the construction of the key program of National AI Project, the Industrialization and Application of High Accuracy Face Recognition System.
## Task
* When we want to calculate how many people in a very crowded scene, we naturally calculate the number of people based on the visible part of the body, and the visible part is mainly the head area. This drove us to detect head counting rather than the entire human-based to solve crowd counting problem. The contest invites participants to design algorithms, mainly for the detection of human heads in complex scenes, by indicating the specific position (x, y, w, h) of each person's head rectangle. In which, x represents the coordinate on the x axis, and y is the coordinate on the y axis, w is the width of the face rectangle, and h is the length of the face rectangle.
